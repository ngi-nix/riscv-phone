## fw/fe310/test/Makfile
- Find out if we can do without `bash` at the beginning of line 29.
- Find out where is `riscv32-unknown-elf-gdb`, required by line 29 (`riscv32-none-elf` doesn't seem to provide it, nor `riscv32-none-elf-gdb` seems to exist). 
- Find out if we can getk rid of `-L../../../` at line 22.
